# Pellychan
A 4chan desktop app because I hate the web!

Pellychan is a desktop client for anonymous imageboards like 4chan. *(But currently only supports 4chan).*
It's not built on top of web browser technology; it uses its own GUI framework written from scratch to support a low resource footprint.

Named after me because [I'm a fucking narcissist](https://x.com/GratThemeParks/status/1726392454406906204).

## Features (mostly WIP)
* Not made from a web browser
* Multiple windows (WIP)
* Thread archiving and saving (WIP)
* Post history (WIP)
* Thread "bookmarks" you can use to check back on your favorite threads (WIP)
* Customizable fonts, colors, and styles (WIP)
* No tracking or analytics
* Low CPU and memory usage
* Optional GPU acceleration
* No ads
* Completely [free](https://www.libreware.org/p/libreware-definition.html#gsc.tab=0)
